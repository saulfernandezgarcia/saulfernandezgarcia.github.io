# A winter project across Japan and China

My winter vacations for my 2023-2024 course were packed with wonders to discover, and I even edited two videos of the places I visited and ways I spent my time.

As a collaboration with the UNNC FoSE Faculty of Sciences and Engineering Marketing Team, I recorded and edited two videos in which I shared how I spent my time during my winter vacations in Japan and in China. As you will notice, I carry with me a teddy bear in a nice white UNNC labcoat. Furthermore, I tried editing the videos to the beat of the music; I find that this, despite making the editing process a bit longer, gives a sense of momentum to the video (besides, who doesn't like a song by Twice, right?).

Let's watch the videos and read a bit about them!

## Saúl and BlueSee in Japan

Shortly after I finished my exams, my kendo 剑道 friends and I travelled together to Japan! While I will talk my interest for Japan in a different blog entry, I'll just say here that I KNEW that, if I studied in China for my 3rd year of my bachelor's degree, I would DEFINITELY go to Japan at some point. Thus, around November~December, I mentioned to some of my kendo teammates that I was going to go to Japan in winter after the final exams and that I would love for them to come with me. After a quick meeting in the library, we defined the places to visit and the date.

Osaka, Nara, Kyoto, Fujikawaguchiko, and Tokyo. My trip with my kendo friends was unforgettable, and I cannot wait to go back to Japan and keep on exploring! During the video you will see how the FoSE Bear takes a bit of the spotlight, I think it had lots of fun as well. ;]

(Also, I really really really liked finally visiting and onsen 温泉!!! It was fun to instruct my friends about the onsen etiquette).

## Saúl and BlueSee in China: Beijing and Rizhao - 中国:北京和日照

After coming back from Japan, I spent some time back on campus, got to experience some activities organised by the UNNC so that our winter holidays were also an opportunity to keep on learning about Chinese culture, and finally travelled with one of the friends I made in karate at the UNNC to his hometown: Rizhao 日照. 

First, I went to the China Sea Studios Marine Legend Theme Park 中国海影城 as a trip organised by the UNNC, where we got to experience wearing traditional clothing (I really like the option I chose in black and white) and taking part in crafts and cultural heritage of the region, 象山, like Fish Lights Dance 舞渔灯 or River Fish Printing 鱼拓 (making a print on a surface like canvas with a fish and some paint). Then, my long-yearned-for trip to Beijing 北京! I planned visiting Tiananmen Square 天安门广场 for the flag rising (it is with sunrise, so you should be there really early!)， the Mutianyu 慕田峪 segment of the Great Wall, and The Forbidden City 故宫, among other places. Finally, I travelled with my friend to Rizhao 日照， where I got to live the Spring Festival, New Year, and all the connected traditions in their full glory together with a Chinese family. Decorating the house, visiting the 阿姨s and 叔叔s of my friend, lighting up firecrakers, making and eating 饺子... Being part of a Chinese family during one of their most, if not their most, important celebrations is a memory that I will forever keep with me.

## Regards

Thank you so much to the UNNC FoSE Marketing Department for this opportunity. I am so happy for having been able to collaborate in such a cool project and to have my final product in different social media for people to see how I, an international student, can get involved in Chinese culture. I really consider it can be a mind-changing video for many watchers out there.
