# Compromise and Recognition: the Global Ambassador Award

The UNNC grants the Global Ambassador Award to only 5 students that prove their contribution to campus life and, as estated in the [official UNNC site](https://web.archive.org/web/20240623105625/https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/global/scholarship/scholarship-for-non-degree-students.aspx):
> [...] in promoting UNNC exchange, PGT and PGR programme to their fellow students in their home universities and home countries. 

In order to apply, I provided the GEO Global Engagement Office with evidence of my campus involvement, participation in meetings for improving future exchange students experiences, updates on my experience in China and at the UNNC through social media, support in activities organized by the UNNC and GEO (like the Global Fair during the first semester, where I represented Spain), continuous volunteering with the UNNC Marketing Department and student associations, involvement in Chinese Culture courses, and my active membership in sports clubs (specially kendo). I was notified by the GEO that I had obtained one of the 5 awards on the 20th of December, so it was a comforting way to get started with the studying for the final exams :).

I feel really grateful to now officially hold the position and responsabilities of a UNNC Global Ambassador. I am looking forward to both strengthening my collaboration with the UNNC and making the most of my experience here in China while learning about the culture, language, and people.

Regards, \
Saul FG
