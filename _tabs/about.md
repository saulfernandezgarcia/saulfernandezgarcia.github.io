## HELLO! •ω•✧

I am Saúl Fernández García, 荣浩宇, a Cybersecurity Engineering Bachelor's Degree student at the University Rey Juan Carlos URJC in Madrid, Spain. Due to my consistent high performance both academically and in extracurricular activities, I obtained one of the 50 national "la Caixa" Foundation Scholarships for Bachelor Degree Studies, which I continue to hold and renew annually.

I find interest in network security and earned my CISCO CCNA certification in 2023. During my year as an international exchange student at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), I not only improved my level of Chinese but also developed an interest in software testing techniques, pentesting, and the applications of machine learning with Spark.

After achieving the Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE) by Cambridge with Grade A at the age of 17, I began learning Mandarin and I am now studying for the HSK4 level.

Additionally, I enjoy doing kendo, writing haikus, and have a deep appreciation for Japanese and Chinese culture 😉

# The Blog

You are now at my blog, so feel free to wander around :). I want to keep it as an outlet for my experiences, thoughts, and other findings.
